# Spotify-Song-Popularity-Classifier
For this project, I use a machine learning approach to build a classifier that predicts whether a song will be popular depending on factors such as the artist (artist popularity and number of followers), the audio profile of the track, and other relevant factors. As the features that contribute to the popularity of a song vary from genre to genre, I decided to restrict my attention to the hip hop/rap genre for the purposes of this project. I start with a dataset of Spotify tracks obtained from Kaggle and add additional data that I scraped from the Spotify API using Python's Spotipy library. I utilize Spotifyâ€™s API in conjunction with Python and its libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Spotipy, and more) to scrape and perform data cleaning and preprocessing. Finally, I use logistic regression, k-nearest-neighbors, and support vector machine models to build classifiers for the popularity of a hip/hop rap song.
